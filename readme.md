# Router

A wrapper around the [nikic/fast-route](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) package.  
The project as such is not affiliated with the creators of the fast-route package, but rather just a wrapper to be
used in Jitesoft projects.

Documentation might be added at some point.


## State

The package is missing some key features that are to be implemented, which makes this a pre-release.  
Do not use for production if you are not sure you know what you are doing!


In the loop:

* Usage of `groups` in the routing.
* More tests.
* Other stuff.
